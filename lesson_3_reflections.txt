When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You want to use a remote repository when you want a backup of your local
repository, when you want to maintain copies of your repository on multiple
computers, or when you want to share your repository with other people.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You should manually pull changes from a remote, so you can decide which changes
are added to your local repository. There are situations where you do not want
to pull changes automatically like if another person updates the remote in a way
that interferes with what you are working on in your local repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are repositories created by copying a repository on GitHub to your account
on GitHub. Clones are repositories created by copying a remote repository to a
local machine or created by copying a local repository on a local
machine. Branches are collections of commits in a local repository.

You create a fork when you want to modify a repository on GitHub you do not have
permission to change or you do not want to change. You create a clone when you
want to have a copy of a remote repository on a local machine or when you want
to make a copy of a local repository on a local machine. You create a branch
when you want to create a modified version of a project within a local
repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The benefit of having a local copy of the last know state of the remote is you
can compare your local repository to the remote or branch from the remote if you
do not have an internet connection.
