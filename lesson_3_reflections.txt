When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You want to use a remote repository when you want a backup of your local
repository, when you want to maintain copies of your repository on multiple
computers, or when you want to share your repository with other people.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You should manually pull changes from a remote, so you can decide which changes
are added to your local repository. There are situations where you do not want
to pull changes automatically like if another person updates the remote in a way
that interferes with what you are working on in your local repository.
