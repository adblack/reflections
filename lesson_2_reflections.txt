What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intitialize a repository using git init, git creates a hidden directory
called .git in the working directory that allows git to track the
changes made to the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files in the repository that will be included in
the next commit. The ability to pick which files go into the staging area
allows the user to control which files are updated in the next commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use git diff --staged to compare the staging area to the most recent
commit and confirm the next commit will only introduce one logical change.
